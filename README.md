# FailProof_Alarm_for_Cargo_Transport
Alarm System for Highly Valuable Cargo Transport

Imagine a truck transporting fragile or high-risk items like diamonds, vaccines, or uranium. Of course you wouldn’t want such valuable items to get damaged. 

So, we implemented a Failproof Foam Alarm System for Cargo Transport which is triggered by monitoring one condition:

•	Truck instability (via a tilt/level meter)
If the tilt sensor is triggered:

•	A servo motor activates and dispenses protective foam to cushion and secure the cargo.

•	A buzzer is activated to alert nearby personnel.

•	LEDs/LCDs display the warning.

This system addresses the crucial safety need in high-risk transport sectors. The foam protects cargo from mechanical damage, while audio-visual alarms ensure prompt response. It combines mechanical actuation and real-time electronic detection in a smart embedded system.

This is our project for Microprocessor subject, SKEE3223 for **UTM** university!
